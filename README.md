# DEVFEST 2025

# MedLink Backend & Frontend

This repository contains both the backend and frontend code for a forum and mentorship application built using Django and React (with TypeScript). The backend manages forum posts and replies, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface for creating and viewing discussions. A chatbot to help with interview prep has also been integrated. (https://devpost.com/software/medlink-c4792u). This is the MVP created at the Columbia University DevFest Hackathon in 2025. An edited, and more finalized product can be found at premedcheatsheet.com

## Running the Management Script

This script can be run to view all the posts in the database. The database can be edited (adding posts/replies, changing timestamps, deleting posts/replies) with similar scripts.

1. **Open Django shell:**  
   `python manage.py shell`

2. **Run the script inside the shell:**

```python
from api.models import Post, Reply
from django.utils import timezone

# Display all posts in the database
all_posts = Post.objects.all()
for post in all_posts:
    print(f"Post ID: {post.id}, Title: {post.title}, Author: {post.author}, Timestamp: {post.timestamp}, Replies: {post.replies}")
```

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/posts/ - Retrieve all posts
- POST /api/posts/ - Create a new post
- GET /api/posts/{id}/ - Retrieve a specific post
- POST /api/posts/{id}/replies/ - Add a reply to a post
- GET /api/posts/{id}/replies/ - Retrieve replies for a specific post
